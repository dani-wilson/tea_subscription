# Tea Subscription

Tea Subscription is a mock [take-home challenge](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_be) during module 4 of Turing School of Software & Design's software engineering program, wherein the student is expected to complete the MVP in no more than 8 hours.

## About the Project
This application is a web application designed to produce APIs. The application utilizes Ruby on Rails, with a PostgrSQL database.

### Built With
- [Ruby 3.2.2](https://github.com/ruby/ruby)
- [Rails 7.0.8](https://github.com/rails/rails)

### Configuration
1. Clone this repo
2. cd into the directory where it was cloned and launch code editor
3. run `bundle install` to install gems and dependencies
4. Run `rails db:{create,migrate,seed}` to setup and seed the database

  ### Testing
  To test the full suite, run `bundle exec rspec`<br>
  To see a full coverage report with SimpleCov, use `open coverage/index.html`

  ## Schema
  I chose to create three database tables: teas, customers, and subscriptions. I had thought about creating a fourth joins table, but ultimately decided it made more sense to use 'subscriptions' as a sort of joins table between customers and teas, with customer_id and tea_id being the foreign keys. Since I am a visual person, it was helpful for me to use [this website](https://www.dbdesigner.net/) to plan out my tables.
